## How to Freelance

All my work so far has come from my network. When I started, I offered to buy people a coffee to catch up. Definitely invest in those relationships and make time to continually be doing that, not just getting started.

All the successful freelancers I know are just working their network. This is my summary:



1. Email/contact everyone you know. Don’t spam, don’t use AI, just genuinely try and do what Robbie is saying and catch up. 
2. Cater each interaction to what they are doing. Just saying “please give me work” puts the onus onto your friend to “figure out how you can help them”. Don’t do that. Take the time to understand what everyone is doing, and zero in on things that suck for them. Build a plan and propose it to them. 
3. When getting started: always ‘friends and family’ discounts. Just get the work started
4. The first year or so is hard, but after you’ve cranked out a few projects, and are being known for this work, then it’s much easier there on out
5. Make friends and get to know as many people in agencies and consultancies. These businesses need trusted partners for you to subcontract out of them. It lessens the stress of full time staff on their end, and they take a cut for handling the client engagement/management. win-win-win



At some point, assuming these people like you, you’ll have all these friends and old colleagues that have in the back of their mind that you are now a freelancer and you’re looking for work. So when they go out into the world with their friends, bingo-bango, they can refer you if it comes up



A lot of people crap on the idea of working for free, but when you’re just getting started, I think it’s completely okay to build up propositions and v0.1 builds of your project to entice a potential client and show that you are serious about helping them out. If it works, great. If not, that’s okay too. It’s all good practice



And when I said email everyone, I”m not saying a quick sales, but just catch up and be friendly. Genuinely try and see how’ve they been and what they are doing. The conversation will always naturally lead to “what are you doing” and that’s when you say you’re freelancing and you got all these dope value props.
