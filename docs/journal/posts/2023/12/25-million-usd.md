# When I have $25 Million Dollars

When I have $25 million dollars, I will create a **community maker-space in Medellin Colombia**. 

A Maker-space is a creative workshop with tools like laser-cutters, CNC routers, 3D printers, wood-working tools, metal crafting tools, plasma cutters, textile tools, robotics, jewelry making, software studio - and more. Anything you can imagine, you can build it in a maker-space. 

I will build the maker-space next to a university business incubator.
